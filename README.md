# Machine Learning Practice Repository

This repository contains my **Machine Learning practice work**, including concepts, experiments, and code implementations.  
The goal of this folder is to **learn ML step by step**, practice core algorithms, and build a strong foundation using hands-on coding.

### today I am working on the Dataset for the subscription is or not for the good one and implement the model with there Acuracy compare i do the so changes like a model evualiation and compare the multiple models like Logistic , randomforest and DecisionTree so the next task is not complte
